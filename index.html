  <h1>E-Learning Design</h1>
  <p>As an E-Learning developer I focus on how get are built, not what it is that I need to build. That statement is a lie. I think my architecture degree has given me a strong awareness of user-centric design, and I don't turn that off now that I'm a developer. The following sketches represent parts of real projects where I had a prominent role in the design process.</p>

  <h2>Differentiation</h2>
  <p><i>Built in Articluate Storyline 2</i></p>
  <p>This course was for a non-profit that connects people with tutoring opportunities. The tutors aren't formally trained to be educators, so the organiation chose to create e-learning to give them the basics.</p>
  <p>One of the topics was differentiation: Tailoring instruction to meet individual needs. The tutors would be working with small groups, perhaps 3 children at a time. In general you would begin by working through a single activity as a group, until differences in ability become apparent. Maybe Janice struggles with one thing while Jen struggles with another, and Ben is already on the next page.</p>
  <p>This interaction was repeated in the course three times: One each for reading fluency, short vowel sounds, and comprehension. It begins in the initial group activity, and gives you a sense of what's going on through some introductory text and speech bubbles from the children.</p>

  <p>Then you are given a more abstracted view of the situation. It's a drag and drop interaction with columns and rows. Each row is a person in the group, while each column is an activity. Once you place everyone, inclucing yourself (the tutor), where you think they should be, you click the I'm Ready button in the bottom-right corner.</p>

  <p>If we gave specific feedback for every combination we would end up with 256 different pieces of feedback. On the other hand, we wanted to provide more than just a generic "Try again." We settled on a system of feedback gates. While there may be more than one correct answer, there are certain things you definately should not do, based on the scenario given.</p>
  <p>For example, maybe one of the activities just isn't appropriate for the age group. The first gate can check to make sure nobody is in that activity, and give targeted feedback otherwise. Another common rule was that the whole group should not be in a single activity (no differentiation there), so that would be another gate. The learner keeps trying, and gathering useful information along the way, until all gates are passed. Then you get the correct feedback and move on.</p>
