      <h1>E-Learning Stories</h1>
      <p>The following sketches represent real projects I worked on. As a developer, my focus was on synthesizing the work of graphic artists and instructional designers, and figuring out how to push forward their vision within the constraints of my tools.</p>
      <p>Although I'm a developer, I do more than programming. My architecture degree has given me a strong awareness of the user (easy to forget that buildings have users too), and I don't turn that off to write code. In each of these projects I made contributions to the design, and I led the implementation.</p>

    <a href="#plu" class="anchor"><h2 id="plu">PLU</h2></a>
    <p><i>Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</i></p>
    <p>We created a series of games for learners trying to memorize <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_look-up_code">PLU</a> codes. The games are part of a single course, and offered through a menu which has light restrictions on navigation. The first game is optional, but you must complete the second before moving on. The third is where everything comes together.</p>
    <p>Here are the games:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fruits and vegetables are presented one at a time, randomly, from a list of 50. Once you correctly identify the item shown a keypad appears. The PLU code is displayed on-screen, and at this stage you simply read it and type it in. The keypad can be used with a mouse, or you can use the actual number pad on your keyboard, which is what the learners would be doing in real life. </li>
      <li>Like number one except the identification step is gone and the PLU code is not readily given. If you don’t know the code you need to look it up in the listings, just as the learner would need to do in real life. To look up an item you need to know what it’s called, and if you’re having trouble you can return to game one. To complete the activity, you must answer 25 correctly, but you may go through all 50 if you choose to.</li>
      <li>The final activity is just like number two, except for the addition of a timer. You can still look up any code you don’t remember, but this time you’ll pay a time penalty for it. After you complete 25 you can either return to the menu or try again. Your time is saved, so after next second try you can compare times and see if you’re improving.</li>
    </ol>

    <a class="anchor" href="#differentiation"><h2 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h2></a>
    <p><i>Built in Articluate Storyline 2</i></p>
    <p>This course was for a non-profit that connects people with tutoring opportunities. The tutors aren't formally trained to be educators, so the organiation chose to create e-learning to give them the basics.</p>
    <p>One of the topics was differentiation: Tailoring instruction to meet individual needs. The tutors would be working with small groups, perhaps 3 children at a time. In general you would begin by working through a single activity as a group, until differences in ability become apparent. Maybe Janice struggles with one thing while Jen struggles with another, and Ben is already on the next page.</p>
    <p>This interaction was repeated in the course three times: One each for reading fluency, short vowel sounds, and comprehension. It begins in the initial group activity, and gives you a sense of what's going on through some introductory text and speech bubbles from the children.</p>
    <a href="differentiation_intro.jpg"><img src="differentiation_intro.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <p>Then you are given a more abstracted view of the situation. It's a drag and drop interaction with columns and rows. Each row is a person in the group, while each column is an activity. Once you place everyone, inclucing yourself (the tutor), where you think they should be, you click the I'm Ready button in the bottom-right corner.</p>
    <a href="differentiation_main.jpg"><img src="differentiation_main.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <p>If we gave specific feedback for every combination we would end up with 256 different pieces of feedback. On the other hand, we wanted to provide more than just a generic "Try again." We settled on a system of feedback gates. While there may be more than one correct answer, there are certain things you definately should not do, based on the scenario given.</p>
    <p>For example, maybe one of the activities just isn't appropriate for the age group. The first gate can check to make sure nobody is in that activity, and give targeted feedback otherwise. Another common rule was that the whole group should not be in a single activity (no differentiation there), so that would be another gate. The learner keeps trying, and gathering useful information along the way, until all gates are passed. Then you get the correct feedback and move on.</p>

    <a href="#conversation" class="anchor"><h2 id="conversation">Conversation</h2></a>
    <p><i>Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</i></p>
    <a href="plu_identify.jpg"><img src="convo_big.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <p>A staffing company approached us with a need for training new employees on their customer service standards. We reached for a familiar instructional pattern: The conversation model. This is one of the best examples of camera-over-the-shoulder design. In other words, you're looking at a scene that's reminiscent of what you would see in real life.</p>
    <p>First, you decide how to greet the customer and start the conversation. Depending on which choice you made, the customer will have one of three responses. The customer's image changes to reflect their mood, and they say something back to you in the form of a speech bubble. The conversation continues from there, and coach feedback appears to give you some tips along the way.</p>
    <p>At the end you get to see an online review that the customer has written up about their experience.</p>
    <a href="plu_keypad.jpg"><img src="convo_small.jpg" alt=""></a>
    <p>I'm proud that we were able to make this course fully responsive without losing that sense of looking at a true-to-life scene.</p>
